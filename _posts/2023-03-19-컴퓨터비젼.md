## Region Properties  
**Area** : number of black pixels  
**Centroid** : mean value
**Haraclick's Circularity Measure** :  
Circle = equal distance to one point

**Perimeter** : "closed path"  
4-Neighborhood :  
8-Neighborhood :  
**Second-order moments**  
row moment :  
column moment :  
mixed moment :  
based on the moments we can predict the shape of the object
**Region Adjacency Graph(RAG)**
shows the relationship between objects in graph form

## Distance Transform - Chamfer matching (Binary shape matching)  
makes distance image (smoothing by Gradient Descent) and compare distances to destined object's pixels
